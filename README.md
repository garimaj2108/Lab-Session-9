# Why Recruiters should hire Santa Clara University's MSIS graduates

# Objective

The objective of this lab is to redesign and critique the existing Lab 6 visualization.

# Sponsor

Professor Michael Schermann - Santa Clara University

# Metrics

1st Metric: Top LinkedIn Skills for MSIS students seeking Business Analyst, Data Analyst or Database Analyst job profiles
This metric provides a baseline of the top skills required by students to get the above mentioned jobs.

2nd Metric: Course Curriculum and the skills acquired through these courses

In this metric, I am comparing the courses offered by Santa Clara University against University of San Francisco and the skills that students gain through these courses. This metric helps us determine which College helps develop more skilled workers.

3rd Metric: Average GMAT/GRE or 

Every student wants to enroll in a college which affords them the promise of brighter future through great jobs. This metric helps students determine ROI, by providing salary comparisons between Bay Area vs National average for MSIS specific job profiles.

# Existing Visualization Critique

Link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iKoRXqQVP0NrSpPUzb9xZ4X8XjXiKJKhl32tDm5uEPg/edit?usp=sharing

In this visualization, I have published four seperate dashboards to establish the claim "Choose Santa Clara University for MSIS program."

First Dashboard Link: 
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/CampusSafetyComparison-BayArea/Dashboard1?publish=yes
This dashboard compares campus safety between three colleges in Bay area. For each college the crime rate statistics are being compared across 7 parameters. These seven parameters presented together cause the dashboard to look crowded and saturated with details.

Second Dashboard Link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/CampusSafetyComparisonforCollegesofferingMSISinCalifornia/Dashboard2?publish=yes
This dashboard compares campus safety between three colleges in California. This is an additional dashboard and not required if we would like to restrict the scope to Bay Area.

Third Dashboard Link:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/AverageSalariesBayAreavsCaliforniavsNationalAverage/Dashboard1?publish=yes
This dashboard compares Average bay area business and data analyst salaries against National average salaries.It shows salary information for both job profiles on one sheet,it would benefit from making the dashboard interactive.

Fourth Dashboard Link:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/UniversityRankingsacceptancerateteachertostudentratio/Dashboard1?publish=yes
There is so much wrong with this dashboard. Firstly, I have used bar charts to display University rankings. Second I have combined the acceptance rates data with student-to-faculty ratio so at a glance it looks like the infographic compares acceptance rates to the student-to-faculty ratio.

# Roadmap for improvement

The existing visualization can be improved the following way:
1) Combine all the dashboards into a single Story board.
2) Remove the Campus safety across California data visualization, as we are currently restricting our comparison scope to Bay Area.
3) Make the Campus Safety visualization interactive by allowing users to select the 'Type of Crime'
4) Make Salary comparison dashboard interactive by allowing users to select the 'Type of Job Position'
5) Use tables to represent University rankings data
6) Display College acceptance rates comparison using tables
7) Display Student-to-Faculty ratio comparison using tables
8) Of course, this means create two seperate representations for Acceptance rate & Student-to-Faculty ratio

This will result in a clutter free and interactive data visualization with minimum information displayed. 
This will give students all information required to decide on the University for MSIS program.

# Visualization Redesign

I have implemented all the points suggested in Roadmap to make this visualization truly impactful.

Redesign Link:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/RedesignLabSession5-Iteration4/Story1?publish=yes


Detail about how data is compared: 
- In this visualization I have compared the University rankings, its acceptance rate and student-to-faculty ratio to provide an insight into a University's calibre vis-a-vis its difficulty rate to get an admit.
- It also provides an insight into average Bay area salaries for MSIS graduates to help students determine the ROI.
- And it gives an in depth analysis about campus safety, to help students determine which college environment would help them achieve their goals without having to worry about extrinsic negative factors

# Claim
"Choose Santa Clara University's MSIS Program"

# Extra Information
Intermediate Visualizations
Iteration 1:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/RedesignLabSession5/Story1?publish=yes
Made Minor changes in the argument and representation of claim

Iteration 2:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/RedesignLabSession5-Iteration2/Story1?publish=yes
- In this visualization, initially I was comparing average salaries across different cities in California, I changed it in Iteration 3 to standardize with Bay Area scope restriction 

Iteration 3:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/garima8871#!/vizhome/RedesignLabSession5-Iteration3/Story1?publish=yes
- In this visualization, I was using tables to represent university rankings, acceptance rates and student-to-faculty ratio data. In iteration 4, I have integrated acceptance rates and student-to-faculty ratio datasets and presented them on a scatter plot for easier comparison.

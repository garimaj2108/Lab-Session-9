## Claim
"Recruiters should hire from Santa Clara University"

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to redesign and critique the existing Lab 6 visualization.

## Sponsor

Professor Michael Schermann - Santa Clara University

## Audience Need
The recruiters want to understand which University's students have higher skill set so that they can easily meet their client requirements and targets.

## Audience Wants
Students have all the skill set required for a job profile

## Audience Fears
Every recruiter has a recruitment target. They need to fill X positions either at the company they work or if its a consultancy then targets to meet client requirements. So if a recruiter spends time on hiring a student they want to ensure that the effort gets rewarded into a hire. But if students do not have all skill sets then it would be a uphill path for a recruiter and waste of effort if the student doesn't get hired.

## Existing Visualization Critique

#### What is wrong with the existing visualization ?
- The major flaw is that it has almost no data for a recruiter to determine why they should be hiring from Santa Clara University.
This visualization provides a list of metrics which are of no use to the recruiter
- Campus safety comparison 
- University Ranking, Acceptance Ratio and Student to Teacher ratio
- Average Salary comparison
These are all good metrics for students to make a decision about which University they would like to join, but its no good for the recruiters.
With the redesign visualization I aim to provide a visualization which will help recruiters determine that they should be hiring from Santa Clara University.

## Roadmap for improvement

The existing visualization can be improved the following way:
1) Define Claim
2) Define metrics that would help support the argument of "Why recruiters should hire from Santa Clara University?"
3) Collect data that would support the argument
4) Remove unnecessary visualizations like Campus Safety, Average Salary and University Ranking- Acceptance ratio comparisons
5) Remodel the whole visualization

This will result in a interactive data visualization with relevant information to recruiters.

## Metrics

#### Why I chose these metrics ?
For any recruiter, the most important aspect is whether the candidate has all the skills that are required for a job. So I decided to find the top LinkedIn skills for popular MSIS jobs and mapped them against the courses offered by Santa Clara University and the skills imparted through these courses. This would help the recruiter to immediately map relation between which skills are being offered by the University and they can make informed decision about investing recruitment efforts in that University.

#### 1st Metric: Top LinkedIn Skills for MSIS students seeking Business Analyst, Data Analyst or Database Analyst job profiles
This metric provides a baseline of the top skills required by students to get the above mentioned jobs.

#### 2nd Metric: Course Curriculum and the skills acquired through these courses

In this metric, I am comparing the courses offered by Santa Clara University against University of San Francisco and the skills that students gain through these courses. This metric helps us determine which College helps develop more skilled workers.

#### 3rd Metric: Average GMAT/GRE 

In this metric, I am comparing the average GMAT/GRE scores of Santa Clara University against University of San Francisco. This metric will help us determine the quality of students, because students with higher average scores reflect bright, hard working and motivated students which would of course translate into excellent work resources.

## Visualization Redesign

I have implemented all the points suggested in the Roadmap to make this visualization truly impactful.

Detail about how data is compared: 
- In this visualization I have compared the University curriculums to the skills gained from them, defined a baseline of top LinkedIn skills required for popular MSIS jobs like Business Analyst, Data Analyst and Database Analyst. This helps recruiters understand at a glance what are the top skills for these job profiles and which university students have these skills.
- I have also provided details about the average GMAT/GRE score for students accepted into Santa Clara University vs University of San Francisco's MSIS . University of san Francisco does not have any GMAT/GRE score requirement, which itself elevates the student quality at SCU.
